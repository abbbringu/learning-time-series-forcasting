# Projects Directory

This directory is for organizing individual forecasting projects.

## Structure

Create a separate folder for each forecasting project you work on:

```
projects/
├── sales-forecasting/
│   ├── notebooks/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   └── README.md
├── energy-demand/
│   ├── notebooks/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   └── README.md
└── stock-prediction/
    ├── notebooks/
    ├── data/
    ├── models/
    └── README.md
```

## Project Template

For each new project:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add a README.md explaining the project objective
3. Organize notebooks, data, and models within the project folder
4. Document your findings and results
